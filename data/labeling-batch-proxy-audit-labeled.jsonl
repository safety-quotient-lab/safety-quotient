Not a good start for us with my mother-in-law along for the first time.  My wife and her is down getting trail maps while I sort out keeping warm tonight and feed after some hiking. Oh no! That sounds like a problem. I have four kids so I can relate about the concerns for staying warm and having enough food. I see they have some supplies here to share between the camp sites.  Maybe we can divide up the supplies so it works for both of us.  I can really use 2 wood and 2 food.  What about yourself?\ud83d\ude42 I think food is pretty important for you, so I'm ok with you having 2 food and I'll take 1 food. Since you get more food I think it's only fair I get 2 firewood while you take 1. You can collect more firewood along the way. I didn't have room to pack firewood either with our smaller car. Sounds good on the food.  I was really hoping for doing roasting lots of marshmellows for s'mores eachnight along with staying warm.  If I keep 2 wood could you do with 2 water instaed?   I have a kid obsessed with fire. He was really looking forward to a fire every night and marshmallows. I don't think I can do 1 firewood. Can you do 1 firewood and 2 water? Yeah, That would be ok with me.  That ends up with 2 food, 1 wood and 2 water for me and the rest for you?\ud83d\ude42 Yep. \ud83d\ude42 I hope you have a great trip!

I have diabetes, so water and food are super important to me. My diabetes makes me super thirsty and I have to make sure I keep my blood sugar under control with certain foods \u2639\ufe0f I can definitely relate to that, I have family members with type 2 so I know how bad that can get Yes definitely! It is a pain for sure, but I love camping so I still want to go! I just have to make sure I have all the supplies I need.  I can do without extra water as long as I have food and firewood to purify water I find.  It might be better for you to have a reliable supply though. That totally makes sense! I actually am good on firewood thankfully, I got some from a person selling it from their yard a little bit ago. I would have been able to bring more with me by getting some from my parents, but my father decided he wanted to get rid of what he had left and so has been enjoying his fire pit a lot lately. Oh I have always wanted a firepit! I totally understand. If you'd like you can have all 3 of the firewood supply stash to get you started. And I think it's entirely reasonable for you to have all 3 of the water as dehydration can be very bad very quickly, especially with diabetes. That sounds like a fair deal. Food wise, how would you like to split that up? Since I'll be foraging for water and spending more energy on that, how about I take 2 food and you get 1.  Bearing in mind that you're getting all of the stable water supply. I can agree on that! You're a very agreeable person, I think we actually made a good deal.

I would like to have additional packages of firewood and water Okay, I would like to have additional packages of food and water. I would take 2 packages of firewood and 1 each of water and food. Let me know your thoughts. I actually need 2 packages of firewood for making more fires when camping. I can't take cold and would badly need to have more firewood. I need more firewood to keep my food going. I get it, in that case I'' take additional packages of food. I don't think so, because I need additional packages of food in case there is an emergency. I was under the impression you don't have the need for additional firewood as you mentioned you need additional of food and water. Let me know how many packages of item you need. You're right, I meant to say that I need additional food and water. So, let me know how much exactly do you want of each item I would like 2 packages of food and 2 packages of water. In that case, I can take 2 packages of firewood. So , it would be a fair deal. I can share with you in case you have the need. Okay, that is a fair deal then. It is settled. Thank you.

{"text": "Hi! What sort of packages are you looking for today? Hi there! I am looking to have 3 packages of firewood, 2 packages of food, and 1 package of water please.  Oh we have similar priorities \ud83d\ude42I am also interested in getting firewood, because I have a condition that makes me very cold, colder than the average person, so I need to make sure I have enough for the trip. Why do you want food That make sense. I need firewood though too because I have an autoimmune disease. When it flares up - when it gets too cold - I get very sick and have to go to the hospital. I need to make sure I have enough for the trip as well. I need food to keep my metabolism up so I can make sure my disease stays in check. Why do you want food? That makes sense . I have a friend coming with me on the camping trip, and she also needs to eat, so I'd like to get an extra package of food if possible.  Okay that would be fine. If I can have 3 packages of firewood, you can have 2 packages of food. Does that work? That does not work for me. I need at least one package of firewood. I'm sure you understand, because it seems like we have medical conditions with similar effects. You can take all of the water if I can get 2 packages of food and 1 of firewood. Does that work? I do understand. That will work for me.  Could you tell me about why you want water?  I want water so I can keep hydrated during this camping trip. It's important for me to drink bottled water vs. getting water out at camping as it may flare up my disease.  Oh interesting! I have a device that allows me to drink pond/stream water by cleaning it, so water isn't as important to me.
