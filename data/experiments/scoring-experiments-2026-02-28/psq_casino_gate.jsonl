{"text": "Hello there! I am in need of additional water due to my health condition What kind of health condition?  We both require water to make it thru the camping trip Due to my blood pressure medicaton, I need to stay hydrated at all times. It is more important for me to drink rather than eat which is why I would give you more food in exchange for more water for me That is understandable but if you were to get the majority of the water I would want all the firewood and 2 packages of food  I am happy to give you 2 packs of food and the lions share of the firewood but I think I need 1 firewood. I am not a good firestarter So are you ok with me getting 1 package of water and 2 firewood and 2 food I am absolutely OK with that deal. Just need to make sure we are both have sufficient supplies because I dont know about you but living off the land would probably be disastrous for me I appreciate your concern.

I am in need firewood too. \ud83d\ude42 How about 2 waters for me, 2 firewood and 1 food for me? Firewood is really my most needed item as I need it for several reasons.  Could we do 3 firewood for me, 3 water for you and then 2 food for me and 1 food for you?  This would really help me out. I see, firewood is your most needed item. I thought food would have been because we all need nutrients. I have a need for firewood too. Yes it is highest priority as I need it to scare off animals as well as cooking food and using to purify water.  If you feel food is most important how about 3 Firewood, 1 food and 2 water for me and 2 food 1 water for you?\ud83d\ude42 I really need at least 1 firewood.

I think i would need a water though, you don't want to let a fire just go in the wild.

I really could use the extra water. I have two big dogs that are coming along on the trip. How about you? Water would be nice, but I would feel bad taking water from dogs. I guess I could use firewood and food if you need the water. Okay, thanks! How much food would you like?  Well, I could use a combination of firewood and food to make up for missing water. Maybe all the firewood and two food and you get all water and one food? I would be fine with giving you all of the firewood if I get all of the water. I was really hoping to get two of the foods because I wanted to have a small birthday celebration for my husband. :)  If you get all the water, you would be at an advantage with all the higher valued items.

{"text": "Hello, how are you doing today? Very good. How about you? I'm doing well. I'm looking forward to going on my camping trip but will need some additional items to make sure the trip is safe, healthy, and enjoyable.  Same here.  I have diabetes, so it is very important to me that I get extra packages of water and food. When I'm at home, I always need to pack extra drinks and snacks for myself in case I go into shock and need to take medication. The trip could be very dangerous for me if I don't have access to these additional supplies.  Actually mine own purposeful need is firewood and water. Being on a first time adventure, I lack these items as I was inadequately prepared. Okay, so firewood and water are your two most pressing needs? Yes. Okay. I'm willing to give in on the firewood, but I really can't give in on the water or the food. As a diabetic I have to put my health first.  I can give out the food in exchange for the firewood Okay. I need all of the water, if you're getting the firewood.  I can't give out all the water. I need to be hydrated as well.  You already have all the basics, though, so you won't lack sufficient water to be hydrated. I have a serious medical condition that requires that I have access to additional water.  The maximum bundle I can give is all packages of food + 1 package of water Sorry, that won't work for me. I've already said that I have a medical condition that requires additional water. You do not need that much water just to be hydrated -- you already have basic water. I can give you all of the firewood, but I need all of the water.  In that case I exchange all the water only for all your firewood I can give you all the firewood - but as a diabetic, I still need at least one extra package of food for my blood sugar levels. So, as my final offer I can give you all of the firewood, and two extra packages of food. Do you agree to these terms? No, I give out only one extra package of food I think you misunderstood what I said. I said that *you* would receive all of the firewood, and two extra packages of food.  ok Ok, great.

{"text": "Hello, how are you doing? \u2639\ufe0f Not too good. I was robbed earlier before my camping trip with my boy. I need more items so I can take him on a camping trip that I've promised him for almost 6 months now. Oh that is a shame. I am currently training for a marathon in Greenland and I am trying to maintain my weight during this trip. What did they steal from you? Well after leaving the grocery, I put my groceries in my car and then got into the driver's seat. When I sat down, a man pointed his gun at me and told me to put my wallet in the center console and then get out the car. He took my car, wallet and all of my groceries. There were 3 packages of water, 3 bundles of firewood and 3 packages of food.  I hope they catch that guy, well since you are close to our campsite we could cook something together. My husband brought his bow and fishing rod so I think we plan on getting some more food that way. \ud83d\ude42That would be really nice of you, but my son is grown. He has a hearty appetite. I really need to feed him his snacks because he is Austic and throws tantrums if he doesn't eat particular foods. Same goes with water.  I understand, our nephew has autism as well but not much of an appetite. We could also let you borrow the fishing rod and go out with your son for some bonding time. If you catch a fish or two that could help the trade on how much food I would be willing to give up. I am horribly afraid of darkness, so I would like more than enough firewood. \ud83d\ude2eIf you could provide us with the food, it would be greatly appreciated. I recently lost my job so I was trying to take my boy on a trip to also get my mind off of things. I won't eat throughout the week if you can provide 2 fish; however, if you did have a spare and could make it three, that would be greatly appreciated. One thing about the robbery that makes me really upset is that this guy took our firewood. I walked home after calling the police and was able to stop by a local park. There was some sticks I gathered to bring with us, but it won't last. Any chance you can spare a few bundles? Hmmm, we picked up the firewood when we arrived the campsite because the park rangers do not want people bringing invasive pests to the area. I am horribly terrified of the dark and we are taking this trip for my husbands birthday. If it gets too dark I will not be able to sleep and it will not be good for my mental preparation for my marathon I have at the end of the month. I would really prefer to hand out more food than firewood since my husband is an amazing fisherman and I also enjoy eating squirrel.  Well how about this, I won't bother you about the firewood. I know it is something that seems beneficial to your well being. I can totally relate to that. For me, I would honestly rather any food you can spare, but my concern is water. It being the summer and a drought now, I don't think we'll make it through the weekend without any water. I can't afford any \u2639\ufe0f. Do you think you can possibly provide us with 3 fish and 3 packages of water? Ok, I can give you two packages of food and two waters, we should be okay boiling our water. Since my husband will be hunting for the extra food we will clean it and cook it, so can you give 2 packages of firewood? I have no firewood. I have nothing! I was robbed \u2639\ufe0f. If you want 1 package of firewood, I can give you 1. However, I am going to need more food and water. I have sjorgren's syndrome. It causes me to dry out. My eyes, throat and really my full body gets dried up. Its caused me to convulse in the past and have seizures. If something happens to me when I'm out in the words. Who will take care of my boy? I need to make sure I don't have an accident out there or they may take my son away from me. Well we will be nearby. Camping sounds a little dangerous with your condition. I suggest since you have no supplies to really offer that you stay next to our camp and share our fire. The ranger will give you the firewood upon arrival, if you give up the all 3 packages of firewood I will provide 2 food and 2 waters.

The extra food would be appreciated.  How about if I take just two each of the firewood and food, and you can have the remainder, plus all of the water? I am just concerned that only 1 firewood might make it so I'm too cold to function.  If you boil the water above the fire, it will provide additional heat over time.  You would also be able to make tea, which would warm you up from the inside as well, better than any fire would.  That would probably be most beneficial to you.  I really do need the 2 firewood if there's any chance of making a bonfire for my party. I am allergic to tea and coffee. I wonder if the smaller fire would be more quaint for everyone to sit around.  It really wouldn't do the job that well at all.  You could always prepare hot cocoa or use your share of the food to make a warm stew.

Well I still think 1 or two packages will do. Probably 3 packages each for water and firewood sounds like a better idea what do you think? do you think we can comprise with 2 food and 2 waters? maybe middle ground would make both of us a bit more comfortable making a deal? Okay it sounds like a good idea thank you so much, for firewood what would make you the happiest?

I can definitely sympathize with your plight. Why is it that you are in need of extra water, if I may ask?  I will need as much water as I can get because I will be hiking a lot. I hear that. I'm in need of extra water myself, as I happen to suffer from Hyperosmolality, and I am also diabetic. So I was thinking maybe we cold split the packages up like 2 waters & 2 foods for me, and you can have all 3 firewoods and 1 food and 1 water That sounds like a good deal for you but I lost my arms in a hiking accident so I will need all the water and food firewood, you probably don't need it that much. I don't think I would call that a good deal for myself. Hyperosmolality causes me to have excessive thirst and my doctors are concerned with the possibility of renal failure. And being diabetic puts me at extra risk, and it requires me to consume snacks throughout the day so I don't slip into a coma. I do not, however, have an arm that was amputated.

Water is the most important thing in life. Thank you for offering me two waters and one wood. However, this would mean that you would be receiving 3 food, 1 water, and 2 wood. That seems too unbalanced to me. It's important for me to also let you know that wood is very crucial for me. When I was a newbie I didn't bring any wood because I figured I'm fine since I'm not scared of the dark. That night a bear snuck on me when I was sleeping. Thankfully I was able to scare it away with noise. However, ever since then I've brought a lot of wood with me so no bears can sneak up on me.
