Something she said was \"It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything. Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much. Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel? I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?

{"text": "Well, my fiance and I \"sort of\" broke up recently. I moved out of our place and all, but we continued to see each other at least 3X per week. And we both said we're not 100% sure that we're ok with us being done for good. - We promised to tell each other if we start dating anyone. He said he wasn't interested in dating. Three days after that conversation, I come over unexpectedly to find him making dinner for a woman I've never seen before. Turns out it was his 3rd date with her. He met her on a dating app a week before our conversation about promising to tell each other if we start dating others. To be honest, I'd still be hurt if he told me. But now on top of that hurt, I feel disrespected... and everything I thought I knew about him is kind of crushed. We were together 6 years, and I always, ALWAYS believed he was the most honest, kind, \"stand up guy\" I've ever known. Yes, that's true. The worst part is that he doesn't seem to think I have a right to be hurt. How do I even deal with someone who hurt me but doesn't care to take any responsibility whatsoever? That's true. He didn't invite me over. I expected him to be at work that night. I was coming over to see our cats, which still all lived with him. I still had a key and it didn't occur to me that I could invade his privacy since I had been spending 3X a week with him, and he was fine with me using the key. The whole thing was a shock. I wouldn't have come in had I known what I'd find inside. Yeah. It's a long story to explain here, but at first he told me it was a first date... then he said it was a second date... then finally he said it was a third date. I had to figure out on my own that he met her through a dating app, which makes me feel extra icky because now I kind of feel like a stalker. (Don't worry, I didn't do anything illegal or immoral to figure this out at all. He left an easy breadcrumb trail for me to follow.... but it still feels gross that I felt compelled to research the situation because I could \"feel\" he was lying.) Yes. I'm not only invested in him. I have a SUPER close relationship with his two daughters. Some of the reason he wanted to see me after our \"break up\" is because he didn't want to tell his daughters that I might be out of their lives forever. He told me so much. And I love those girls so much. They're 13 and 16. They were 7 and 11 when I started seeing their dad. That's a good suggestion. I think individual therapy might benefit me. I could ask him if he's open to couple's counseling--even if it's over, it could help with closure. I do. I appreciate your talking the time to listen to me. Sometimes just talking about an issue can help organize one's feelings and thoughts. That is good advice. I haven't been eating or sleeping as well as I should since this all started. I'll work on that. --- Thank you so much for your time and help and kindness. :) I wish you a great weekend! Thank you!!! Take good care, stranger.

I am used to the idea of staying up because I have been doing that since the pandemic early on this year, but I seem to be distracted and procrastinating, especially in the early hours of the morning, and just go on the computer and waste time, etc. it's kind of hard to sit myself down I guess yeah this is my third go through the entire course, the third round of studying. So that the knowledge would be fresh in my mind. just the entire next week is all I have left to get through like 6 units of readings plus finish up the assignment and I have a part-time job, and plus doing some catching with the other course which is all due next month after this course. yeah it sure has. I can go on and on about that too And another thing is by the time I get wise up to not procrastinate, like around 3 or 4 am, I become tired and sleepy, and my brain kicks in and immediately doesn't cooperate. So just a pattern of that going on lately. thanks just gonna do my very best and be mature and catch up because my marks have been good but have been procrastinating, lazy, and slow with everything since the pandemic. yeah it's stupid. Once I am done with these two courses, I can finally stop sleeping so late. Because regardless of the courses, I have been sleeping at around the same time, which is late almost every night, since the pandemic started. so it will be a good time for me to take a breather and reset my bad bad habits and circadian rhythm after these two courses. and get back to some normalcy in my life routines. it will literally be a fresh start, next january yeah exactly, nose to the grind yeah too many bad habits from the pandemic and social isolation. Excessive procrastination, not working out much, eating pattern is bad, sleep pattern is bad, etc. its all linked and most of it is due to the pandemic and the studies is just a reinforcement of this loop, fuels it actually. Thank you. I am getting better as each day brings me closer to the first exam. I am actually catching up and I feel guilty of myself for the bad habits and not doing the courses as well as I should but just at the end, I feel like I am getting a grip on it again. Thank you for your advice I hope I can break my bad cycles like I said. Thanks. Yeah I can see that you understand. That's good thank you very much! I will continue to study after we chat.

No for personal reasons. I just find the disparity between wearing the mask in some states is not as demanding s others. Here the masks do not seem to be mandatory, but 100 miles and it is necessary. I think we are in a long period of recovery because the country has too many laws in different states that are causing demands on the health system. Too much politics behand the virus and helping the people. Florida is mandatory, but Georgia is lacks. Tennessee is mandatory but other states are not as caring.

I'm ready to end this situation because I want the more emotional stuff I know Doug can't give. How do I get out? I heard of people falling for a fling or one night stand but this has gone on for months. Add to that, I see him at work. He's married and I don't see this as more than a long term hook up.

What did those people do to end the relationship if you want to call it that? You keep saying it's good to reach out. I'm reaching out to you trying to find a way to turn off my emotions for this man. My friends don't know about my situation with Doug. I do suspect some people at work are putting us eating lunch and taking walks together as something more. + Doug make my sing and makes my body come alive but his presence is starting to break my heart because this situation is not going anywhere. I need help! It's not Doug's problem it's mine! I don't like his wife because if she was treating him well he wouldn't be with me. So why doesn't she just let him go? I'm starting to think if she was out the picture Doug and I could be together in a real relationship you know what I mean? I don't understand. Doug's married I know that but I want what his wife has so she's not the problem. All I want to know from you is to tell me how to get rid of the feelings I have for Doug or how to get rid of his wife since you think she's part of the problem? Like what? The media says stay inside with love ones. Doug is my love one. Wouldn't I be putting myself at risk of getting the conrovirus meeting someone new? Why do you keep focusing on the wife? You make it sound if I just kill her Doug and I could be happy and I wouldn't have to worry about his Philandering as you call it anymore. Are you saying I'm a Philanderer? You never answered my question about ever being in this type of situation. Did your mate/husband or whatever Philalnder on you and you haven't gotten over it?

I just don't know what to do about it anymore Yes, I don't like to bother others or let other people down It is a lot, I'm used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself. I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease. I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started. Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief I'd be open to doing Yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity. I'm hoping to get out and go for walks once the weather warms up, unfortunately right now there is still some snow on the ground and it's not quite warn yet being in the northeast I did take walks along the path in our development last summer so the cabin fever wasn't as bad as it seems to be with all the snow that basically kept me inside all of february The local FB group is only full of everyone complaining about everyone else (seems when everyone is home things seem to get on peoples nerves more so then when people could get away from home consistently) but I've never heard of the app Neighbors, I'll have to look into that.

Hopefully, but how to deal with it in the mean time? It's been very hard, I've also had to take care of my mother in that time period, but she sadly passed away last march, possibly from the virus and I've been having a hard time processing that grief. That's true, I know many are suffering so much right now and many people have also lost their loved ones. It makes the isolation all the harder trying to handle the grief. It does help to talk, thank you. Do you have any suggestions on how to handle the anxiety? That is good advice, I will try to stay busier. Also, do you know of any support groups online that might be helpful? Thank you, I will look there for others going through the same things, it doesn't sound silly at all and you are an amazing person too. Thank you for listening and your thoughtful help. Thanks, you stay strong too! I know this time isn't easy for anyone. I'm just grateful for the few minutes of help here, you really did help.

It's a lot that is on my plate on top of the other things that I'm responsible for. I agree with you there. It would be nice if they could be in school, but I understand that they shouldn't be.

I need to stop worrying about yesterday and tomorrow and focus on today, but I'm just not very good at that. Yea, I definitely need to get better at doing that. I end up letting them play video games and with toys in the middle of the day sometimes because I have work that I have to get done as well. That's very smart on your part. I really need to learn to actually follow through and do that. That is true and a very strange reference. No, I appreciate the different references. I was just surprised by it.

I feel like this shift to online learning has really taken it's toll on me and my learning. I've tried reaching out to my professors and doing virtual group study sessions with my class mates, but for some reason, things just don't seem to stick that well. Really? I feel like everyone around me is doing fine and that makes me feel that there is something wrong with me. Maybe I'm just slow? I think so? I think it is just the way the material is taught now. We have these \"Zoom\" sessions where everything is taught online, but it just all feels so impersonal. We are expected to read things on our own and then come to class ready to do these activities. I just prefer the old style of attending classes, having someone teach me the material, and then going back and studying on my own. I think it is also the social aspect of this pandemic too. I haven't seen my firends in person in a very long time. I'm worried that if my poor performance continues, then I might loose my scholarship.

{"text": "Hi there! Oh, not too bad - and you? I'm just getting frustrated with a cousin of mine. I really appreciate her support through stuff like both my parents dying last year, and I'm trying to support her, too... But she'll be set off by completely unpredictable things. I try hard to avoid any possible conflict, but she finds a way to get hurt anyway. We hardly ever talk on the phone, which sometimes would be easier. I just feel like she's so close to losing it all the time, I don't want to seem critical. Only in the sense that she could have a nervous breakdown, or collapse from exhaustion. She's really strong, though. Well, I have asked her about counseling, and she does have a counselor. Her husband won't do joint counseling. A decade ago, I might have talked to her mom about it, but her mom is now frail herself, and her own husband is a lot to handle. I feel protective of my aunt, too. I almost feel like her counselor doesn't do much good for her, but I know there are different styles of therapy... I feel like the therapist just echoes back to her how awful her husband is, etc (he's not really that bad, but they've grown apart). But if I ever say anything like this, she just doesn't speak to me for weeks. I know I need to try to approach the topic with her. It would be better in person, but that's not easy now. We live 800 miles apart, too. Her issues, or the issue of her blowing up over anything I say? Her time is so jam-packed, it's hard. I paid for her to take a vacation up near me. But she had two of her kids with her, so we couldn't really talk. I wish I could just have her to myself for 24 hours - ha. She acts like the kids are in danger with just her husband, which is completely untrue. Well, she has her therapist. I'm not sure what I could really do. Yes.... I think talking to our other cousin about her might be a good place to start. I think it might help... It's one of these things - everyone has so much going on in their own lives... But of course it's also therapeutic to feel like you're helping someone you love. So it might be good for both cousins. All three cousins Yes, I agree... Well, I'll give it a shot.

I'm worried about my mental health and also about the risk of COVID. I think that's the problem! I'm TOO competent. I think the company wouldn't give me so much work if I were worse at my job.

How do I manage my anxiety? I don't think the company wants to give me a promotion because that would cost them more money. Maybe another company would pay me better. I have never tried meditation. That's a good idea. Maybe some other people at the company would like to try it too. That's true. Meditation is a good way to get in contact with my emotions. It might help me not feel so isolated. Yeah. I *can* get through this, if I reach out to others at the company. Maybe not the managers, but the other employees certainly know what I'm going through. I feel the anxiety getting better.

{"text": "Just dealing with alot of depression lately due to issues with a lot of things. The most of which being with my ex-gf and her pregnancy. She immediately cut me off once she gave birth, so I haven't met or seen my child. It's been 7 months. We were in the process of working on an agreement outside of court and since this I've had to work with the court to get this started but it's been hard with COVID and not being able to meet with someone in person. No. That's the other thing. She didn't let me know about the birth until 2 hours after the fact. The hospital would only let one person there with her and her sister was there. I don't know if she put someone else as the father or not. Thank you. I appreciate that. I've been in contact with the Self-Help center at the courthouse to help me with the process of getting a DNA test and getting things going on a case. There's been some issues with the paperwork which is part of why it's taking a while. Once it gets fixed and approved, it should be easy from there. There's no expediting it though I'm afraid. Thank you for that last message. It's really encouraging. Thanks. I'm glad to have talked to you too. Well, aside from that, I'm pretty stressed about school too. Psychology Thanks! I read. I also like to play video games or listen to music. Unfortunately most of my time is spent on schoolwork and taking care of other things. But when I do find some time, I usually play a video game or do some reading. For reading, I like to read a variety of genres, like mysteries and self-help books. As for video games, I tend to play anything. Mostly, I've been playing to shut my brain off, so it's games like GTAV or Call of Duty. That's a good idea. I actually just downloaded an Assassin's Creed game.

{"text": "Hello? It's okay. Thank you for replying. So I have some issues with time management. I am trying to manage having my kids's learn virtually at home, while I'm completing my Master's, and working at night. I feel like I have to drop my Master's because it all seems like too much. I have used those tools. With the current environment in the world, I feel like dealines are a waste of time. I'm trying to go with the flow and just set daily goals. So you understand how the virtual learning has affected the day to day goals? I used to work during the day, complete my school work when the kids are in bed, but now everything seems so stressful. That's a great idea! Two of my kids are old enough to work independently most of the time, they are 11 and 8. However, I also have a 3 year old that requires constant attention. Unfortunately, her daycare is closed. Even more, I had to take on my nephew because his mother could not handle the virtual learning. I never even thought of support groups. It would help to connect with other moms, just to remind myself that I am not alone in this. Thank you so much. You also have a busy bee on your hands! Definitely have to go with the flow. They make life wondefully unpredictable. Thank you and those are fantastic ideas. I'll have to create a naptime, that would be the most helpful. Thank you so much for the wonderful advice. I will be looking into support groups, 2020 has definitely been a shake up for the whole world. I truly appreciate your support!

The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that's the same for everyone. I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I've always had a low mood but now I'm anxious that it will continue to get worse. Since lockdown haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don't want this to get any worse. What if she isn't available? What like support groups etc? I'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It's weird and a little concerning to be honest. I hadn't thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays. I'll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues? That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways. It's good that it's recognised these days at least. I think this is why it's always best to see a professional. I really should try to reconnect with mine.

I see, thankfully I do not have any. yeah we got a lot of things planned for them at the campgrounds. they're going to be pretty busy So what is your main focus this trip? one of my kids is on medication so we are going to need to pack a lot of water. so if could spare that it would be appreciated. Well sadly I plan to go hiking a lot so I will need lots of water, but perhaps we can come to a reasonable agreement if I have to shorten my hikes. ok what do you have in mind? Well if I gave you a majority of the water, I would like 1 water, 3 firewood and 1 food. so I would have 2 water, 2 food and 1 firewood? My kids were looking forward to making s'mores. If I could get 2 water, 2 firewood and one food, that would be great! You would get 2 water and 2 food, I would get 1 water and 1 food for hiking and 3 firewood for having to stay out longer in the dark to complete my hiking goals. doesn't really seem fair for you to get all the firewood. I would like to have at least one because then we're completely in the dark. You get lots of water and food for your children, I am cutting back on my goals by giving up energy which means I have spend more time outside hiking.  I do need to stay warm yes which is why you have two firewood. I think it is fair for me to get at least one. If food is so important to you then I'll give you two food. but we would be in the dark I suppose that's fair enough.

I think we legally have to :). I really miss little things like going out for coffee or to the gym though. It makes me feel like will never be the same again.

I keep having morbid thoughts about what will happen if the pandemic never ends. That's why I'm here ;). You are being very helpful, thank you! It's just nice to be able to tell people what I am worried about and not have them think that I am just being silly. That does sound like really good advice.

{"text": "Hello. I'm going to do a lot of hiking on my camping trip and need as much water as possible. I'm also planning a bonfire with fellow campers in the area, so I'd like as much firewood as possible. How about I keep the water and firewood and you keep the food? That doesn't work for me. I will also need extra water because I drink a lot. How about we start by saying you get the firewood, and I'll take the food? OK, but how do we split up the water? Because it sounds like we both need some. What if you take all the food and I take all the firewood and then I get two waters and you get one extra? I would prefer to have 2 waters since I agreed to give you all the firewood. But I agreed to give you all the food. Now that you want two waters, I think I should have some food because I left a bag of my food at home. You get two waters and I get one of the food. Then you get the majority of both the water and food. So I get 2 waters/2 food/0 firewood, and you get 1 water/1 food/3 firewood? I think that works for me. Yes, that's the plan. By the way, what do you need all that food for? You didn't say. I'm just curious. I'm a bigger guy (6'3\") so I eat a lot, especially after activities like hiking and kayaking. Same reason I want water really. OK, that makes sense. I don't eat as much as you do, so it's only fair that you get most of the food.
