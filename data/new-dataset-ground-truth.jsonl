I say let's try and split the waters.  We are going to be in an area where there is little potable water.  I don't have a water filter either.  The extra water will be very important for our group.   I understand. We will have a big group (about 10 people) so we are trying to have as much water as possible as well.

I'm also planning a bonfire with fellow campers in the area, so I'd like as much firewood as possible. How about I keep the water and firewood and you keep the food? That doesn't work for me.

I would prefer to have 2 waters since I agreed to give you all the firewood. But I agreed to give you all the food. Now that you want two waters, I think I should have some food because I left a bag of my food at home. You get two waters and I get one of the food. Then you get the majority of both the water and food. So I get 2 waters/2 food/0 firewood, and you get 1 water/1 food/3 firewood? I think that works for me. Yes, that's the plan.

How about I take 2 firewood as 1 should do you for a couple nights. I also have small children with me and would like to have the fire burning at all times to keep the bugs away.  I really dont see giving up that much of the wood as I cannot risk running out myself. We are camping way too far out to get access to additonal lighting. I tell you what if you will let me have 2 of the fire wood I would be willing to give you two of the food items. I know that racoon probably took your food as well!! Okay that is a deal.

It's always lovely to have a camping companion you can cooperate with!  I completely agree and i am glad that we could work together and compromise. Absolutely! I am sure we will be able to find a good spot with some firewood around! I always bring my axe, so I will let you borrow it to chop wood around camp. This is also a great season for mushrooms to be growing! That would make a great side dish to the fish!

And I want to make sure everyone stays hydrated with all of the hiking they want to do I get that. I'm going to risk it with the lake water because I'd personally love to have enough food to last 3 weeks (which I'm a little worried about as it is), so I can definitely help you out with the water. thanks! where do you plan on camping?

I'm not totally sure on the details, I'm letting my boyfriend plan and I'm just handling the packing haha Lol, that's totally understandable. Are you planning to make any campfires?

Also, there's only one stream in the area and it's really far from our campsite, so it would be super inconvenient to have to hike there everyday to refill our canteens. We are in a forest though, so we should be good for wood. Since you can easily fish, what if I take 3 food and 2 water? You can keep all the firewood. \ud83d\ude42 Well I have to have some food and I don't need all of that water.  How about I take 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food.  I do need the firewood to cook the fish but I dont need it to keep warm at night because I have hefty sleeping bags that work excellent in the cold. That could work, but I'm still a little worried I won't have enough food for 6 people. How long are you guys going to be camping for? I will be camping for 3 day so I gotta have some food.  Although, I do understand your situation. I see. Yeah, if any of us knew how to fish or forage, we wouldn't need as much, but we're all from the city, so our survival skills are pretty bad and we're going to be camping for almost a week. But I get that fish aren't super reliable for food either... \u2639\ufe0f I understand.  So we have came to an agreement that I get 2 water, 1 firewood, and 1 food, is that right? Yeah, that sounds good to me. Thanks for being understanding. I hope your camping trip goes well.

I'm definitely scared of heights, so that's out for me. I'm heading to the Puget Sound to camp near the ocean. My wife is from the puget sound. Was just up there a month ago.
