{"text": "Hello, I am looking for help in managing some depression. I am feeling resentful towards my husband for quitting his job, and my son for being the reason that he quit his job. My son's behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us I have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. It's hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future. My son is very defiant and argues with us about everything we try and get him to do, but he expects us to give him money for fun things that he wants to do when he isn't willing to work or even help out around the house I try to go for a run every night, that does help. It is hard to keep my emotions separate from what is going on with him Yes, I could do better at that. I want him to have fun and do things with friends, but I want him to be willing to work for what he wants, too. I do struggle with expectations. I want him to be someone that he is not willing to be, I need to let go of that and just let him be himself and not base my emotions on his choices. I feel guilty sometimes taking time to do things that I like and that are away from my family. I can see that I need to do that more, though. Thank you, it is helpful to know that other people have felt the same way. Thank you!", "source": "esconv", "text_id": 11083}
