## Recommendation: **Dual Licensing (Research-Only + Commercial)**

Based on the research, I strongly recommend **Option 3 (Research-only) with a commercial licensing tier** - essentially a dual licensing model. Here's why:

### **Why Not Pure Open Source (MIT/Apache)**

**Ethical Concerns Are Real** [^2][^14]:
- Surveillance technologies can cause "surveillance-related stress, paranoia, and ethical concerns" that erode mental health
- Psychological assessment tools face "integrity threats" from improper releases and misuse
- The PSQ Content Evaluator could easily be weaponized for employee surveillance or discriminatory screening without proper safeguards

**APA Ethical Guidelines** [^6][^10] emphasize that psychological assessment tools must be used appropriately with proper validation - pure open source provides no control over misuse.

### **Why Not Pure Proprietary**

**Scientific Validation Requires Transparency** [^3][^7][^8]:
- Open science principles emphasize that "reproducibility is a major principle underpinning the scientific method"
- "Open instrumentation, like open data, is key to reproducible science"
- The PSQ framework's credibility depends on peer review and independent validation

**Community Adoption Benefits** [^1][^5]:
- Psychology Tools demonstrates successful free access to validated assessments
- Open source psychometric tools are growing (jsPsych, Python/R pipelines)
- Network effects are crucial for validation - more users = better calibration data

### **Dual Licensing Solution**

**Research-Only License (Free)**:
- **Academic institutions** can use, modify, and validate freely
- **Non-profit organizations** can implement for legitimate safety purposes  
- **Individual researchers** can contribute to validation studies
- **Source code transparency** enables peer review and reproducibility
- **Ethical use requirements** built into license terms

**Commercial License (Paid)**:
- **Enterprise deployments** require commercial license with ethical guidelines
- **SaaS providers** must share revenue and follow usage restrictions
- **Consulting implementations** require certification and oversight
- **Revenue funds** ongoing research, validation, and ethical oversight

### **Implementation Framework**

**Ethical Safeguards** [^12][^13]:
```
- Mandatory ethics training for commercial licensees
- Prohibited uses: employee surveillance without consent, 
  discriminatory screening, punitive applications
- Required: informed consent, human oversight, appeal processes
- Regular audits of commercial implementations
```

**Validation Requirements**:
- **Open validation dataset** for research community
- **Peer review publication** requirement before commercial use
- **Continuous calibration** with human expert ratings
- **Bias testing** across demographic groups

**Revenue Model** [^11][^15][^16]:
- Research institutions: **Free**
- Small organizations (<100 employees): **$500/year**
- Enterprise: **$5,000-50,000/year** based on usage
- SaaS providers: **Revenue sharing** (5-10%)

### **Precedents Support This Approach**

**Successful Models** [^9][^11]:
- MySQL pioneered dual licensing for infrastructure tools
- Many database and infrastructure companies use this model
- Balances growth with control and sustainability

**Psychology Field Examples** [^4][^5]:
- Psychology Tools provides free access with commercial licensing available
- Established pattern in psychological assessment tools

### **Why This Serves All Stakeholders**

**Researchers**: Free access, transparency, validation opportunities
**Ethical Organizations**: Affordable access with proper safeguards  
**Commercial Users**: Professional support, legal clarity, ongoing development
**Society**: Prevents misuse while enabling beneficial applications
**Developers**: Sustainable funding model for continued development

### **Next Steps**

1. **Draft dual license terms** with ethical use requirements
2. **Establish ethics advisory board** with psychologists and ethicists
3. **Create validation consortium** of research institutions
4. **Develop certification program** for commercial implementers
5. **Build community governance** structure for ongoing oversight

This approach honors both the **open science principles** that make the PSQ scientifically credible and the **ethical responsibilities** that prevent psychological tools from causing harm. It's the only model that can achieve widespread validation while maintaining necessary safeguards.

The PSQ Content Evaluator is too powerful and too important to be either completely open (risking misuse) or completely closed (limiting validation). Dual licensing provides the ethical middle path.
